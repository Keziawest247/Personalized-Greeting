# Personalized Greeting Creator

This program stores a collection of greeting strings in a list, which are organized into a dictionary for easy access. The main function, run_all, prompts the user to enter their name and select between a random greeting or a manual choice. Based on the user's selection, the corresponding function is executed. Finally, the program enhances the chosen greeting by writing it to a greeting file.

A Python program that prompts users to select or receive a random greeting, then writes it to a fileâ€”ideal for enhancing personalized communication like email outreach.

Built an interactive tool using functions, dictionaries, lists, and file handling. Implemented error handling with try/except blocks and the random module. Learned how to structure reusable scripts for everyday productivity use cases.
